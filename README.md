# Inventory

Assignment, *sigh*. Time to work.

> It's possible that this repository will eventually become `CSF3023`.

## TODO

Scripts that revolve around 2 **pseudo-csv** text file, [`stock.txt`](stock.txt) and [`order.txt`](order.txt).

First, these should be done:

- read and process pseudo-csv file (100%)
- ~~uninversal sort function (0%)~~ 
- string sort function (100%)
- int sort function (100%)

Then, these (sigh): 

- sort order by date
- stock left after order
- critical stock
